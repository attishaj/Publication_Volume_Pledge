Background: “Take the Volume Pledge” proposes restricting pancreatectomies to hospitals that perform >= 20 per year. Our purpose was to identify those factors that characterize patients at risk for loss of access to pancreatic cancer care with enforcement of volume standards.

Methods: Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from Florida, we identified patients who underwent pancreatectomy for pancreatic malignancy from 2007–2011. American Hospital Association and United States Census Bureau data were linked to patient-level data. High-volume hospitals were defined as performing >=20 pancreatic resections per year. Univariable and multivariable statistics compared patient characteristics and utilization of high-volume hospitals. Classification and Regression Tree modeling was used to predict patients at risk for losing access to care.

Results: Our study included 1,663 patients. Five high-volume hospitals were identified, and they treated 1,056 (63.5%) patients. Patients residing far from high-volume hospitals, in areas with the highest population density, non-Caucasian ethnicity, and greater income had decreased odds of obtaining care at high-volume hospitals. Using these factors, we developed a Classification and Regression Tree–based predictive tool to identify these patients.

Conclusion: Implementation of “Take the Volume Pledge” is an important step toward improving pancreatectomy outcomes; however, policymakers must consider the potential impact on limiting access and possible health disparities that may arise.
